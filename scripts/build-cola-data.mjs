   build-cola-data.mjs — turns src/data/cola-history.csv into src/data/cola.json
   consumed by the COLA calculator, the Key Dates page, and the methodology page.

   Refreshing from the source (optional, requires network to BLS/SSA):
     - Official COLAs:  https://www.ssa.gov/cola/
     - CPI-W (CWUR0000SA0) series: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/  (BLS API v2)
   The bundled CSV keeps builds reproducible offline; update it each October
   after the SSA announcement.
