/* ==========================================================================
   build-aep-data.mjs — turns src/data/aep.csv into src/data/aep.json.

   The Annual Enrollment Period is the fall window for changing Medicare
   coverage; whatever you change takes effect January 1 of the following year.
   The enrolment season and that coverage year move together, on a schedule of
   their own — the COLA year and the Part B figures year both roll at different
   moments, so neither can stand in for them.

   The season used to be written into markup as a literal, which meant the page
   would keep advertising a window that had already closed until somebody
   noticed. Keeping it here lets the build assert a season is actually declared.

   Refreshing each autumn: add the next season's row and move `status=current`
   onto it.
