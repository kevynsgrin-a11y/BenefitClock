# BenefitDial

**An independent, ad-supported public utility for the fall benefits season.**
BenefitDial helps U.S. Medicare beneficiaries do two things in under a minute — with
no phone number, no lead form, and no data selling:

1. **Estimate their Social Security COLA raise** and see the amount they actually keep
   after the Medicare Part B premium is withheld.
2. **See exactly what changed in their Medicare plan** year over year — premium,
   deductible, maximum out-of-pocket, star rating, and dropped extras — using the public
   CMS Landscape and Crosswalk files.

The whole product is a **static site** (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) with **zero runtime
dependencies**, built for near-zero hosting cost on Cloudflare Pages and monetized
purely through **programmatic display advertising** — never carrier/broker commissions,
lead sales, or captured PII. That business-model choice is deliberate: it keeps the site
outside the CMS "chain of enrollment" (TPMO) definition and out of the insurance sales
funnel entirely.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm run build      # regenerate data + assemble dist/
npm run serve      # preview at http://localhost:4321
npm test           # unit tests for the COLA + plan-diff math (node --test)
```

No `npm install` is required to build or run the site — there are **no dependencies**.
(`playwright-core` is used only by the optional browser verification and is installed
transiently, never committed.)

## How it's built

A tiny, purpose-built static-site generator (`scripts/build.mjs`, ~200 lines, no deps):

- **Pages** live in `src/pages/*.html`. Each starts with an HTML-comment front-matter
  block (`title`, `description`, `slug`, `nav`, `scripts`, …) followed by body sections.
- **Layout** (`src/layout.html`) wraps every page; **partials** (`src/partials/*.html`)
  provide the header, footer, independence disclaimer, and ad slots via `{{> name }}`
  includes. Shared figures/dates are injected as `{{TOKENS}}`.
- **Assets** (`src/assets`) and generated **data** (`src/data/*.json`) are copied to
  `dist/`. `sitemap.xml`, `_headers`, `_redirects`, and `robots.txt` are emitted too.

```
src/
  layout.html            # document shell (head, OG, JSON-LD, skip link)
  partials/              # header, footer, disclaimer, ad slots
  pages/                 # one file per page (front-matter + body)
  assets/
    css/site.css         # the entire design system (senior-first, WCAG-minded)
    js/
      lib/cola-core.js       # pure COLA math  (shared by browser + tests)
      lib/plandiff-core.js   # pure diff logic (shared by browser + tests)
      cola.js / plan-diff.js # progressive-enhancement UI wiring
      nav.js
  data/                  # CSV sources (committed) -> JSON (generated, gitignored)
scripts/                 # build.mjs, build-*-data.mjs, serve.mjs, verify-browser.mjs
tests/                   # node --test unit tests
```

### The build fails fast on purpose

Every figure the pages quote about someone's money comes from the data layer, and
the build refuses to substitute a plausible-looking literal when the data stops
carrying one. `npm run build` exits non-zero — it does not warn — when:

- **a required figure is missing**: the confirmed or projected COLA, the COLA
  announcement date, the Part B premium/deductible, or the Part D cap. The
  historical failure this prevents: promoting the projection to `official` in
  `cola-history.csv` without adding the *next* year's projection row used to
  leave the site quoting the previous estimate (`3.6%`) in 41 places, including
  "A 3.6% COLA on a $2,000 benefit adds about $72 a month". Build exited 0 and
  every test passed. Now it stops, and the error names the CSV row to add.
- **a `{{TOKEN}}` survives into the output**, which would otherwise ship literal
  braces in front of a reader.
- **`SITE_URL` is not an absolute origin.** It must include the scheme —
  `https://benefitdial.com`, not `benefitdial.com`. A protocol-less value used to
  build cleanly while emitting relative canonicals and `og:image`, non-absolute
  sitemap `<loc>` entries and broken JSON-LD `@id`s.

## Data sources (all public domain)

| Source | Powers | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CMS **Landscape** files | Plan availability, premiums, org names | Late Sep / early Oct, annual |
| CMS **Crosswalk** files | Prior→next plan ID mapping + status (the diff engine) | With Landscape |
| CMS **PUF / PBP** files | Drug tiers, deductibles, supplemental benefits | Monthly / annual |
| BLS **CPI-W** (`CWUR0000SA0`) | COLA calculation | Monthly |
| SSA **COLA** announcement | Confirmed COLA figure | Announced Oct 14, 2026 |
| CMS **Parts A & B premiums and deductibles** fact sheet | Part B standard premium + annual deductible | Published Nov, effective Jan 1 |
| CMS **Part D redesign / annual parameters** | Part D out-of-pocket cap (IRA; indexed annually) | Annual |

### Updating the data each fall

Three data sets make up the whole annual update. Every CSV below is committed;
the JSON they produce is generated and gitignored.

- **COLA — `src/data/cola-history.csv`.** After the SSA announcement, promote the
  estimate row to `status=official` **and add a new `status=projected` row for the
  following year**, with its `source`. Both steps are required: the build now
  *fails* when there is no projected row rather than silently reusing the previous
  year's estimate in money copy. The error message names the row to add.
- **Statutory Medicare figures — `src/data/medicare-figures.csv`.** One row per
  year carrying `part_b_premium`, `part_b_deductible` and `part_d_oop_cap`. All
  three are **indexed annually**, so none of them may be typed into page markup;
  pages reference `{{PART_B_PREMIUM}}`, `{{PART_B_DEDUCTIBLE}}`,
  `{{PART_D_OOP_CAP}}` and `{{MEDICARE_FIGURES_YEAR}}` instead. Add the new row
  each November with `status=official` and the publication date in
  `source_updated`; `scripts/build-medicare-figures.mjs` takes the latest official
  row as current. The build fails if that row has no Part B premium.

  > **Caveat — the 2026 row wants one primary-source confirmation.** `$202.90` (Part B
  > standard premium) and `$2,100` (Part D cap) were corroborated only through web
  > search across independent secondary sources — direct fetches to cms.gov,
  > medicare.gov and federalregister.gov returned 403 from the environment the
  > figures were gathered in, so no government page was read first-hand. Before
  > relying on them in production, check the CMS "Medicare Parts A & B Premiums
  > and Deductibles" fact sheet and the CMS Part D annual parameters directly, and
  > correct the row if they differ.
- **Medicare plans:** drop the real CMS CSVs into `src/data/` as
  `landscape-current.csv`, `landscape-next.csv`, and `crosswalk.csv`, then rebuild.
  `scripts/build-plan-data.mjs` ingests them automatically. **Until those files are
  published, the plan tool runs on a deterministic, structurally-faithful _sample_
  dataset** (`manifest.sample = true`) so the tool is fully demonstrable — every sample
  plan is flagged `sample: true`.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Build output directory:** `dist`
- **Environment:** set `SITE_URL` to the production **origin including the scheme**
  (`https://benefitdial.com` — the default). A protocol-less value is rejected by
  the build, because it would otherwise emit relative canonicals and `og:image`,
  non-absolute sitemap `<loc>` entries, and broken JSON-LD `@id`s while exiting 0.

`_headers` sets security headers (HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, a restrictive
`Permissions-Policy`, etc.) and cache policies. `_redirects` maps friendly aliases.

**Cache policy note.** Assets are *not* content-hashed — `/assets/css/site.css`
keeps its URL forever — so `/assets/*` and `/data/*` are served
`max-age=0, must-revalidate`: bytes stay in cache, but every request revalidates,
so an unchanged file costs a 304 and a changed one can never lag the HTML that
references it. The previous `stale-while-revalidate=604800` meant a returning
visitor could get up to **8 days** of new HTML rendered against old CSS. If asset
filenames ever gain content hashes, switch those blocks to
`max-age=31536000, immutable` (there is a note in `_headers` at the spot).

There are two ways to deploy; either alone is sufficient:

1. **Cloudflare Git integration** — connect the Pages project to this GitHub repo
   (production branch `main`) with the build command/output directory above.
2. **CI deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)** — pushes `dist/` to Pages with
   wrangler on every push to `main`, independent of the Git integration. Enable it
   by adding two repository secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Pages: Edit permission)
   and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`; optionally set the `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT`
   repository variable if the Pages project isn't named `benefitdial`, and
   `SITE_URL` if the origin isn't `https://benefitdial.com`.

   **If those secrets are missing the workflow fails.** It used to finish green
   with only a `::notice`, which meant `main` showed a passing check while
   production kept serving the previous build. If you do not want CI deploys yet,
   disable the workflow (Settings → Actions) rather than leaving it reporting a
   success it never performed.

### How CI gates the deploy

`deploy.yml` does not duplicate the checks — it *calls* `ci.yml` as a reusable
workflow (`verify`), and its `deploy` job `needs: verify`. So:

- a red CI genuinely blocks production, instead of racing it in a parallel workflow;
- there is one gate definition, so deploy's checks cannot drift out of sync with
  CI's (deploy's copy had already lost the COLA-calculator / plan-diff page
  existence checks and the unresolved-`{{`-token grep);
- both use the Node version in `.nvmrc`, not one pinned literal each;
- checkout uses `fetch-depth: 0`, because sitemap `<lastmod>` is read from
  `git log -1 --format=%cs` per page and is omitted entirely at depth 1;
- `verify` uploads the `dist/` it validated and `deploy` downloads *that*
  artifact, so the bytes published are the bytes that passed.

The gate is: unit tests, a clean build, the five must-exist output files, ≥13
pages, no unresolved `{{TOKEN}}` in the emitted HTML, and a check that every
internal `href`/`src` in the built pages resolves to a real file — which is what
catches a typo'd `slug:` that still produces 13 pages while the nav link to one
of them 404s.

## Monetization & compliance stance

BenefitDial is **not** a broker, agent, or Third-Party Marketing Organization (TPMO):

- It takes **no** carrier or broker commissions / CPA and sells **no** leads or data.
- It captures **no** personal information — no name, email, or phone number — and the
  calculators run entirely in the browser.
- It never recommends a specific plan for compensation and always points users to the
  official **Medicare Plan Finder** or **1-800-MEDICARE** to enroll.

Ad-network loader scripts (AdSense/Mediavine/Raptive/etc.) attach at the single marked
spot in `src/layout.html`. See `/how-it-works` and `/privacy` on the site itself.
